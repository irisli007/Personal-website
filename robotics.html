<h2> Robotics </h2>
  <p> I am a member of Newport Robotics Group,
    in which I have helped organize and lead meetings, teach members how to build electrical and pneumatics systems, trained drive team for competition,
    and have played a vital role in getting my team to the World Championship by driving and fixing the robot in competition
